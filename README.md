This is my play area, to just play with code.

Currently, I have added to java programs that I have previous written:
	Palindrome.java ( pass palindrome.txt as an argument)
	KeyCounter.java ( pass namevalues.txt as an argument)

And I am using these 2 programs as a jumping off point to recreate them in
different languages to see how they might change and as a learning tool.

At this point I have rewritten them in Groovy:
	Palindrome.groovy ( pass palindrome.txt as an argument)
	KeyCounter.groovy ( pass namevalues.txt as an argument)
	
Since they are pretty simple programs the changes are not significant. So,
I plan on adding more complicated programs.
